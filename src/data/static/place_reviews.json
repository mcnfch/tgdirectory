I'm dairy-free and love sorbet, so their 5 different sorbet flavors work perfect for me. My sons both had a cookie dough milkshake, and 9 had a black cherry freeze. My only knock...the line was out the door, and they were way understaffed for a Saturday. It was just 2 employees working the counter. Really only 1 because the other had to keep the area stocked. Could have definitely used another pair of hands helping out. Other than that, we were totally satisfied customers. As long as you have patients, I would highly recommend stopping in.",

I felt like I was intentionally misled.The bill came up to almost $30.00 for two people before tip. Plus they charge a fee for using a card. When I asked why I was told that the cashier goes the weekend dinner price is the same as the week day dinner price which makes no sense because it was like 12pm.  No dessert really. Pizza wasnt out and no cranberry sauce. And its always a debate if the cornbread is available. Probably won't be back.  I wouldn't have came for that price. Might as well went on to another buffet.\n\nUpdate: There was no menus on the table when my party came in and why would I be looking for signs or a menu when I called ahead of time before I drove across town to restaurant. And I came for the buffet. It's a small restaurant so there's no reason why anyone answering the phone wouldn't know the current price of the meal. Especially a cashier. She literally paused and thought about what she was saying. Could've made sure if she didn't know. I'm sure most people are paying cash. There was nothing on the bar that you don't see during the week. And if you add pizza ever 7 to 8 minutes why was the bar completely out of every kind of pizza. You shouldn't wait till it's completely out to put some out. And I'm confused at dinner time vs lunch time because you don't open till 11 most days and I was there early. No was it was dinner time.",

However, once we were seated, it took fifteen minutes before we were able to order drinks and the latte I ordered didn\u2019t make it to the table for 40 MINUTES! Once we were finally able to order food, it took over an hour between being seated and getting our meals. We were so perplexed as it looked to us like there was more than enough staff to accommodate the number of guests, but even the tables beside us were complaining about the wait times. The French toast I ordered didn\u2019t not come with the warm spiced peaches as it\u2019s supposed to since they had run out earlier in the day, which is fine, but then why did I still spend $14 on plain french toast? We also ordered a side of bacon that was the driest, most dehydrated bacon we\u2019d ever seen. Just thoroughly disappointed as I\u2019ve been to three other Frothy Monkey locations and this one was nothing like the great experiences I\u2019ve had at the others.",

It was seasoned perfectlty, fell right of the bone and served over rice. It was a really large amount.\n\nThe coarse was one of their deserts. It was perfect to end on. It was a few bites and not overly sweet.\n\nWe ordered a side of octopus. It dish was small but had a very complex flavor profile. The octopus was super tender and cooked perfectly. I highly recommend ordering.\n\nThe service was extremely quick for such a large meal.

        "text": "We participated, with high expectation and anticipation, in the Valentine\u2019s Day dinner cruise. The menu posted on their site highlighted a slow-roasted prime rib with \u201crich\u201d flavor, a lemon basil chicken with zesty flavor, a vegetable medley full of vibrant colors, smashed potatoes that were the \u201cultimate comfort food\u201d, a crisp and fresh mixed green salad, soft and golden dinner rolls, and a desert slated as the \u201cgrand finale\u201d. My wife and I also purchased an add-on package for a charcuterie board highlighting fruits, nuts, cheeses, and meats. To begin, the prime rib delivered on its tenderness. The quality of the meat\u2019s doneness was exquisite. However, this was overshadowed by a lack of flavor in an otherwise enjoyable piece of meat. The chicken, on the other hand, did not deliver on any of its promises. The meat was overcooked and lacked any flavor whatsoever. There was no zesty flavor, no lemon, no basil, and not even any salt or pepper. It tasted like this chicken had been blanched in a vat of hot water for too long. There were no \u201cvibrant colors\u201d on the selected vegetable medley. The only vegetable offered were slightly warm and crunchy green beans that were, again, lacking in any substance or flavor. The \u201csmashed\u201d potatoes also lacked in any richness or \u201ccomfort\u201d as promised. At the top of the buffet tray was a pool of butter and hints of seasoning, but this was not carried throughout the remainder of the potatoes leaving a bland and gritty potato dish behind. The salad met expectations as promised. The salad offered a mix of greens including arugula, spinach leaves and romaine pieces accompanied by shredded cheese, tomatoes, and a delightful vinaigrette dressing (there was also a ranch dressing available). The dessert was another disappointing piece of this disastrous puzzle that left you bewildered and longing for better. Upon entry onto the vessel the deserts were already placed on your table setting teasing what was supposed to be the \u201cgrand finale\u201d leaving you \u201csmiling with every bite\u201d. Once we had finished with the main course of the evening and moved onto dessert, we were greeted by a warm and unappealing cheesecake that had long outlived its freshness and luster. It\u2019s possible this dessert COULD have been better had it been fresh/chilled. Overall it lacked any flavor and seemed to be a basic cheesecake. The highlight of the evening, without a doubt, was the charcuterie board. The fresh fruit paired with the flavorful cheeses and meats made this add-on a pleasant addition to the evening. In closing, after spending nearly $500 for the entirety, ($99/person, gold package add-on $99, 15% protection plan package in case of needing to cancel, and tax) I can say I left very disappointed with the overall experience. The ambiance of the boat as well as the atmosphere simply could not compensate enough to offset the disappointment of the meal. After fasting the entire day in anticipation of this wonderful and delightful evening, we were left wishing for more and regretting the decision to pay as much as we did for an experience that didn\u2019t come close to compensating for what we paid for. I would advise against investing in this experience, and would instead advise to go and spend a fraction of the cost on an evening and experience that will produce more flavor, more interest, and more overall satisfaction.",

Order a drink and my usual rockfella oysters I ask the waitress could I get them well done cooked a little more. She told me I could not do that because she will get in trouble in get audit for it. Her boss will get her if she put my order in to be cooked well done. I told her I was just there last night and they done it for me no issue so this would be day 2 of me going back in a row. Told her that\u2019s fine just go ahead in put the order in. Brought them out and they was so good. I then placed another order and they brought them out in 2 minutes in was cooked to my standard told them they can take them back. The manger came out in said hello I see you sent your sent your order back I said was not cooked to my standards and he said I can not allow you to that anymore if you I will have to ban you from the restaurant and you will not be able to come back to me in my mom. I said what did you just say! He said I can\u2019t have you here. Asking for well done and we don\u2019t do that the owner told me we could not do that! I feel so disappointed and disrespected I have been coming for years and leave great tips know the staff and this how you treat me! He said we can\u2019t allow you to order your oysters like that. I told him that not right when I\u2019m paying for it\n\nThen he said you people can\u2019t get doing that sorry it\u2019s out of my control! I felt racial profile!",

This is a hard review to give because my wife and I had a different dining experience sitting across the table from each other.\nI really enjoyed my meal. I had the 14oz New York strip with a loaded baked potato and it was excellent. I ordered it medium rare with garlic thyme butter and it was cooked to perfection. (See the first picture.) Whoever cooked this knew what they were doing.\nHowever.\nMy wife ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with shrimp in a key lime sauce and that's where things went downhill.\nThe piece of fish was very small. Maybe  3 bites worth. (See second picture. The Sea Bass is right above the line on her plate.) We asked our server about it and she agreed so she called the manager. He was very nice and tried to explain they had different sizes and said they would cook another piece and would bring it out shortly. We continued eating and her meal tasted good until she got to the mushrooms. She gave some to me and they were so over seasoned they were practically inedible.\nAfter 6-7 minutes the manager brought a second piece of fish that was the same size as the first. My wife starts to eat it and realized she couldn't cut it with her fork because it was seriously under cooked. It took 5 minutes to get anyone's attention and our server took it back to the kitchen. After another 5-6  minutes the manager brought it back and apologized again. This time the fish was flaky and tasted great. After eating the second piece my wife came to realize her first piece was probably undercooked as well. We also  ultimately figured out the Chilean Sea Bass was only supposed to be 4oz. pre cooked weight. For over $30 we expected a bigger piece of fish.\nEveryone there was nice if somewhat inattentive. (It wasn't busy at all but we had a hard time getting anyone's attention.) The manager did give us a free dessert to go for all of our troubles.\nI hope you can understand how difficult this review was. We live 1 1/2 hours from Firebird's Chattanooga so I don't know if I'll get back there again but if I do I'll update my review.",

The atmosphere was nice and probably would be even better in the spring or summer time with the view of the water. We sat at the end of the bar where they shucked the oysters. I ordered the \u201csmoked\u201d maple old fashioned, which was not smoked. But it wasnt bad. We shared the oysters bienville which I would not recommend. It was described as broiled oysters with creole crawfish sauce and andouille sausage. The oysters were raw under warm crawfish sauce and if I didnt look at the menu description again, I wouldve mistaken the andouille sausage for freezed dried beet bits. There was also extremely abrasive chunks of blue salt for some reason. But the drink gave me a nice buzz, so we continued on to dinner when we were notified our table was ready.  We were sat by the clear garage doors with a view of the water. The waiter offered a specials menu, so I ordered the roasted monkfish. It came with mashed potatoes and some sort of olive situation. It came out as one big white glob with bits of chopped up olives. I couldnt tell the difference between the mash and the fish. I think it was just reheated. It was very dry. Maybe I shouldve known because the waiter said it was a Valentine\u2019s special menu, but it was already 2/15. I also ordered the fig and rye. It was very sweet and the syrup in it was very thick. Overall, considering the cost of it all, I wouldnt go back. It was just too costly and not very good. Disappointing because we dont go out to eat that often. We were hoping for a real treat.",

For a total of $21, you will receive two strips of brisket, approximately \u00bc to \u2153 inches thick, and two sides that are likely to be approximately \u2153-\u00bc cup each. I WILL NEVER RETURN HERE. My family told me Memphis and Nashville are known for good q. I know why...it is because although you pay $$, they actually feed you. I literally would've gotten more meat if I went to Red Robin. Don't get me started on the taste. Brisket dry, sides taste like store bought. I guess I was so tired. After 10+ hrs of driving, I was willing to ignore the red flags: 1) staff presence was almost nonexistent for walk-in/ to-go order. I waited at the front, then the bar, and then I finally decided to go find a staff member to place my order. 2) I didn't check my food before driving back to my hotel. I just assumed this highly rated establishment would be my new fave. I learned my lesson.",

The food was amazing but we both agreed that it was not worth the price. As customers spending over $400 that evening, we did have high expectations and ran into several issues. The bathroom was not well kept (mystery liquids on the floor), we had to box our own food and the dessert was missing things mentioned on the menu. Don\u2019t get me wrong we would definitely go here again but just for a date night where the pricing is ~50$ a person.",

        "text": "I never write reviews but I don't want anyone to have the same experience my family did. We had a group of 5 adults and 2 children. We went for the first & LAST time on Sunday 12/22, when we arrived only 1 group was seated and they left shortly after we arrived so we were the only group eating. I asked a blonde woman wearing a blue hoodie that was working at the bar if we order at the bar or have a seat and she just replied you can. She did not smile or seem to want us there, I asked what she recommended food wise and she said I don't know, so I said that's ok and ordered then found a table to sit at. The rest of my family ordered and were rudely told that we ordered the rest of their burgers so now they are out. We waited a long time for our food and a younger woman brought it out, she was nice but our food was cold and she told us she didn't know what was what. Another woman with red hair started working at the bar and was the only one who made us feel welcome, she was very friendly and helpul. I went to the bar and ordered another drink and the blonde woman gave me and my sister the wrong drinks but we didn't say anything due to her attitude. We asked if the gift shop was open and were told no because someone left early. Before we left, my daughter asked where the bathroom was and a group of staff and an older man sitting at the bar said right in front of you, you are walking right towards it then started whispering to one another. We smiled and remained friendly despite how we were treated and told them all to have a good evening and a Merry Christmas. The blonde just stood there looking mad and the red head replied and was again very friendly. Later that night we were all sick and kept having to go to the bathroom.",

The service was the worst I've seen in quite some time. 3 bartenders behind the bar and not a 1 of them knew what the word hustle means! I stood waiting for drinks for 20+minutes and never got them and this was right before midnight on New Years Eve. Horrible service and everyone of them needs replaced because they are not right for that job!! Thought that was how great bartenders made amazing money by getting it done behind the bar and getting nice tips because they are recognized for there work!! These 3 acted like they should get paid for just being there and literally watching paint dry would be more exciting!!!",

She took our order but didn't write anything down. 10 minutes later she came back and asked us to repeat the order but still never wrote anything down. After 40 minutes, we got one of the tapas we ordered. We never got our drinks the whole time we were there, despite reminding the server several times. We just had water but really wanted to try the cocktails we ordered but never got. Second and third tapas arrived about 20 minutes after the first. Food was AMAZING and couldn't have been better. We wanted to order more but didn't dare try. The one server that seemed to be working every table kept walking up to tables with plates of food and asking if this was their order. The place is beautiful. Super short staffed though, and that definitely affects the experience. Would love to go back, but not for a repeat of this visit. Everyone was nice but they are clearly overwhelmed.",

We come back at this time and are told it is a 30-45 minute wait past our reservation time. At this point we go and sit at the bar.\n\nThe bartenders were extremely disappointing. It appeared that there were only two bartenders making cocktails for everyone in the entire establishment for tonight. That seems like poor planning on managements side for a night like Valentine's day. It took over 20 minutes to get someone's attention. I had to ask for a menu twice just for a customer to bring me one because the bartenders were that busy.\n\nOne bartender was obviously too stressed and emotional to accommodate patrons in a meaningful manner. They were loudly complaining about how busy the night was and how stressed out they were. Well, it's Valentine's Day. That is one of the busiest nights of the year for nicer restaurants.\n\nWhen we finally got our names called for our reservation, 45 minutes later, we actually were taken out of the restaurant, and into what appeared to be the adjoining hotel's conference room to have dinner there.\n\nAt that point, my boyfriend and I were extremely disappointed and contemplated leaving. The dining area was set up like a seminar hall for work conferences.\n\nVery embarrassing and disappointing for a restaurant that advertises good service & dining expectations. Never have I been to a restaurant and they've seated me into another establishment, a conference room for that matter. That was a first experience.\n\nWe sat down at a table (at the hotel conference room, not the restaurant) that was so unleveled and unbalanced that putting a plate on it would cause a drink to knock over. We asked our waiter to fix it and he didn't so my boyfriend shoved a napkin under the leg of the table so it would at least stay upright.\n\nBefore I sat down into my chair there was actually food on the chair and I had it swapped out. Our waiter gave us our drinks. The straw that finally broke the camels back was when we actually saw the meat come out on skewers, and how awful it looked.\n\nAt this point we got up and left and went to Taco Mac. If anyone asks me about this place, this is the experience I will tell them about. I probably would've had a better experience in a sit down Krystal. Taco Mac did a great job taking care of us.",

Right down the street. Same parking) and our IDS were magically validated.\n\nMaybe she was at the end of her shift, maybe she just put her dog down. But manager Lila will not be seeing us again.

The steak was so dry that my wife nearly choked, and I was moments away from having to step in\u2014this is not an exaggeration. The potatoes, green beans, and lobster were also overcooked and dry, with the only redeeming item on the plate being the corn.

Before we had to go to Dough Pizzeria in San Antonio to get a proper pizza. The wine was also amazing. Not that sweet sugary stuff you get at most of the semi-local wineries within driving distance to Middle Tn. We left with 3 bottles. Each had a flavor combination we\u2019ve never had before. Our server was very informative about the menu and our options and was very attentive our whole time there. The owner came out and talked to us about his family and recipes. We will definitely be back soon.",

I couldn\u2019t use my gift card and pay the difference because my gift card didn\u2019t cover the entire amount. So then I called in to try and place my order. I got an automated message telling me to place to-go orders online. So\u2026 looks like Longhorn Steakhouse is getting my $50 gift card and I will continue to avoid Olive Garden as I have done my entire life. Hopefully the day will come when big businesses remember that getting repeat business happens when the customer experience is pleasant and not an inconvenience. I know Mr. Olive Garden doesn\u2019t care, but I feel better after leaving a 1-star review. If Mr. Olive Garden would like to talk about it he\u2019ll need to submit a ticket online to my personal time website or call into my automated personal time hotline.",

        "text": "We had a birthday party and EVERYTHING was OVERCHARGED based on what the prices were online. They were EXTREMELY RUDE when we asked if adults could bowl and basically told us that it's a kid party and adults shouldn't be bowling at a kids party. Then after looking at the receipt,  they over charged us for 5 kids. And when I called to see if they could give a partial refund for that overpayment, I was YELLED AT by the owner and told that I was the problem because I didn't keep up with how many kids checked in at the front desk. They are the absolute rudest people that I've ever felt with. Never in my life have I been yelled at after being ripped off by a business.\n\nRESPONSE TO THE OWNERS REPLY:\n\nI asked multiple times how many kids checked in to the party to get shoes and was told you weren't sure. I quite obviously gave up and said \"whatever you have counted that attended\" and was told you didn't have the number down for the kids that showed up. And I told you that we used the 3rd lane for 1 extra kid and put a few others to bowl that lane as well as on the other lanes. And you knew that 4 went home which is why we used the same 10 kids per Lazer tag game. And yes I got upset and cursed at you because you were yelling over me and I couldn't get a word on. THAT IS NOT CUSTOMER SERVICE!  Respect is a big thing and you nor the rude man up front have any of that at all. And I was told you couldn't break down the package but the package was completely broken up on the receipt. It literally says 14 bowling 14 Lazer tag,  28 pizza which was actually only 2 pizzas at 55.00 and then the other 2 pizzas were 27.00 then you charged 60.99 gratuity that was not mentioned ANYWHERE until due. Not to mention the fact that we were supposed to get invitations with that package. Never got those. And each child was supposed to get a free game of future bowling and when I asked about that on the phone you said you didn't do that bc your business is closing Friday. That was never mentioned, and that would have given the kids 6 days to go redeem their coupon. But you just decided against even giving those at all even though I paid almost 500 for a party that was priced at 280.00\nBut the most frustrating part of the situation is the way you handle your customers concerns. Yelling at them on the phone is completely unprofessional and you deserve to go out of business for screwing people over!",

I had beef tacos and they were perfectly seasoned, not one ingredient overpowered another and when I say perfectly served- right down to the presentation, perfect. Definitely worth eating at once a week in rotation! The server was so kind and considerate, super friendly and we didn\u2019t have to run her down. To top it all off, the manager, Zach- he greeted us when we came in, seated us and told us a bit about the restaurant. He came back later to check on us, too. Again, real friendly, funny, knowledgeable and considerate. Atmosphere is an all around great feeling and any sports you happen to be watching will be on one of their wall to wall tvs! Since it was my first time, they gave me a free dessert of pure sinful flavor! My goodness, y\u2019all must come eat here. My husbands burger was top 3 burgers in Chattanooga, hands down. Fabulous experience- fabulous staff, which can only mean that the manager Zach has created a very special place to eat. Thanks Taco Mac",

The Mushroom Cannelloni was as richly cheesy and wonderful as remembered and I have never found anything like it elsewhere. We enjoyed everything and will be back for more.",

Asked for fresh grated Parmesan and was handed dried Parmesan in a shaker. There was a winged bug in my sweet tea. I brought this to the attention of my server who said she would replace it. I waited over ten minutes to get a replacement tea. Shocking really.  I do have to say that the server was really great at the beginning and very sweet about checking in on us often. I think she just ended up really busy when we were waiting for the replacement glass of tea.",

The bread was very softy and chewy. It was perfectly portioned and wasn't left overly full.\n\nThe latte was very tasty and mild. However it should be noted they don't offer low fat milk options. The tea was losse-leaf steeped perfectly. However I wish they would give you a bigger cup!\n\nParking instead great, but not to difficult to find parking. The restaurant will validate your parking.\n\nThis place is very popular. Be prepared to stand outside! This is very important if you can't handle waiting in the cold. However service is decently quick.",

So many fancy words and fresh ingredients on the menu that it was difficult to order, and I loved that experience. You get your bakery item immediately and the coffee is served where you walk up to get it; the food is delivered to you where you sit. There is passion in the work of these employees, even the bakers and cooks in the back. My plate was full of savory eggs, potatoes, cheese, ham all slammed artfully together in a skillet that was stupid hot. I loved it so much even if I burn the heck out of my mouth! The caramel latte was great to enjoy after eating, and the water is this pristine stuff from a tap that you get yourself near the bakery-viewing window. The seating was fairly limited, so get there early because this place is popular! I ended up sitting with some really cool people and they had great conversation. I am full of food now and I am happy. Good post-workout food with high protein! (+1 for the Erlanger discount)\n\n-Blackberry lemon lavender scone 4/5\n-Caramel latte 5/5\n-Ham and gruyere skillet 5/5 (had some awesome bread to eat with it....once again let that puppy cool down haha)",

If you gonna claim to be the best, then you need to give your best at ALL times.  Probably would not recommend for the fact that there are so many other good BBQ restaurants in the area.",

        "text": "Honestly one of the best places I\u2019ve eaten at in the Southeast. We went for our anniversary and enjoyed several cocktails with our tapas. The service was impeccable- our server explained the menu well and was warm, but gave us just the right amount of space to talk and really enjoy our evening (sometimes I feel rushed out of restaurants and this was not the case at Amada!). Truly, everything we tried was so well seasoned, had so much flavor, and had beautiful textures. Reminds me of a meal in a Michelin-star restaurant. Plus, our bill was so reasonable for everything we ate and drank. I was really blown away! I\u2019ve begun recommending this place to all of my friends, even though most of us live over an hour away. Also, parking is pretty easy if you\u2019ve ever parked in a city- find a spot, follow the payment instructions, etc. Highly recommend!!",

I ordered the cinnamon swirl french toast and it was extremely dense cuts of loaf bread with little flavor. almost like the consistency of fruit cake\u2026? i was a bit confused. I ate 1 of 3 slices before giving up. Husband had a basic egg & cheese biscuit but it was the oddest biscuit we\u2019ve ever had haha i think we were expecting more of a southern style biscuit and it was far from it.\nDefinitely for some because the place was very busy but not for us.  However I will reiterate that every employee we encountered was amazing.",

OJ says fresh squeezed but it\u2019s Great Value OJ (you can see it in the fridge). $2.50 to add cheese to my omelette but they didn\u2019t add it and my server was too busy eating her own meal at the bar to check on me at any point after delivering my food (even after she finished eating). Grits were very lumpy and lacked any flavor. I ordered a fruit bowl and the grapes still had little pieces of vine so you can\u2019t eat that with a fork because you have to pick at it. Finally got to the pineapple and it tasted strange, almost like they used a dirty knife or cutting board or maybe it was sitting exposed in a fridge? All that and parking is it free.\nI\u2019m only leaving this review so they know what they need to improve upon. I really hope they make the changes needed to succeed. I can\u2019t say I plan on coming back, there\u2019s just too much good brunch competition around here.",

However my friend and I finally got the chance to swing by.\n\nI ordered the Iced Lavender Latte with oat milk and my friend got the Iced Peppermint Mocha. I've heard great things about this place, and once I had my first sip of my drink I knew why. My latte was just outstanding. My drink was flowery, it had the perfect amount of lavender syrup. The espresso and oat milk blended together so smoothly, and the sweetness level was exactly how I like my drinks to be. I have no complaints about this drink, it's my standard latte reference now. My only complaint is that I finished this drink too quickly because it was that good.\n\nThis place is very cute. The coffee shop is in a small space inside, and there's another space across with more seating. Service was great, they were very friendly. I loved the greenery all around the space and decor. It had such a cool vibe. I love how they redid the space in a historic building. The soft pink theme and lush green plants make a cute combination and overall theme.\n\nI look forward to coming back here again and I'll recommend this place to anyone.",

I have IBS so eating can be challenging at many places but when you argue about chicken being pork and my boyfriend is a farmer and confirmed it was chicken then you no longer deserve a tip plus he came by the table three times once to seat us and take our order one refill of tea then to drop off the check... My boyfriend and Son got sick immediately after eating here. We won't be back again we frequent many Thai restaurants but this was the worst I've ever been to with so many better Thai restaurants choose some places else if you have any dietary restrictions please avoid because if they are going to serve whatever they want it's not safe here if you have food allergies",

But the main reason I write is out of a concern for the safety of customers and staff.\n\nAt least the last 4-5 times I have been to the Broad St. location, there has been at least one homeless person hanging out somewhere in the store. Usually the worst that happens is they ask for your leftovers, but the last time, a man was sitting at the closest table to the door with his belongings strewn all over the table, including an open sleeping bag which I had to step around on my way out of the store. He immediately got up from the table and got behind us in line and then for whatever he ordered, if he actuallyordered anything. I was with my daughter, and we had planned to eat there, but this guy made her so uncomfortable she preferred to take ieat at home.\n\nAnd the whole reason I stood waiting for the food in the waiting area instead of at a table that last time I was there (within the last couple weeks) was because the time I was there before that, a man who was in line in front of us when we arrived got out of line while pretending to take a call, fiddled with the peanuts behind us while we ordered, and stole our food when it got called while I was in the restroom.\n\nThe kind staff immediately re-made the order for me to their credit, and it is always service with a smile from them. I write this though in part out of concern for them, however, as while there are 4-6 people usally on shift, most if not all of them lately have been rather small women who would have trouble subduing an adult male threat if one of these characters ever decided to be even more aggressive.\n\nNeedless to say I won't bring my daughter into this store again.",

        "text": "I ordered a take out dinner for 8:15pm on 02/14/25 - rib eye steak cooked medium rare with a side of broccoli and a garden salad from the Chattanooga, TN Longhorn. I showed up to Longhorn at 8:13pm, pulled into a ToGo parking spot, and checked in using the text they sent me at 8:08pm. After waiting for over 15 minutes, I finally got out of my car and went into the restaurant to pick up my food. Sure enough, my meal was just sitting at the bar, bagged up and ready to go, but forgotten by the servers.  I walked out with my food at 8:34pm, 21 minutes after arriving. Unfortunately, I had already included a tip in the amount I paid - I will not make that mistake again.\n\nWhen I got home and began to eat, I found my steak was cooked maybe medium well, more likely well done. It was the toughest and dryest rib eye steak I\u2019ve ever had the misfortune of eating. The salad and broccoli were fine - no complaints there. But overall, the \u201cstar\u201d of the show was disgusting. I literally fed half of it to my dog because I didn\u2019t want any left overs. Fortunately, there is a Texas Roadhouse and an Outback within 5 minutes of Longhorn - guess I\u2019ll be going there next time.",

However, the biggest problem is the food: the crepes are bland and doughy with color only on a single side with every other part tasting and feeling more like a ravioli. The sauces are too concentrated and overused (likely to cover up the crepe itself) overpowering the ingredients used inside. The savory crepe ingredients taste as if they forgot to open the spice cabinet.\n\nWould not return as it isn't worth the cost, especially when you don't even get a full glass of lemonade when you order it",

Now normally, this would be just an inconvenience. For me, it is not. I\u2019m paying for the delivery because I cannot drive - I am disabled. You guys for some reason only use uber eats which is another awful company. So since your restaurant was closed by the time I got my food I couldn\u2019t even pay MORE money and uber there and back to get WHAT I ORDERED. And to top it off, uber eats thinks the photos I sent are correct?! Caesar salad dressing ISNT GREEN OLIVE OIL!!!!!!!! I will never ever make the mistake of ordering food from Panera ever again.

My kinda place. It was relaxing. I'll say it again, it was relaxing",

There does always seem to be a staffing issue with this store so product can be slow to come out and the coffee dispensers are empty more times than not, so don't be in a hurry to grab something quick and get out. The food quality has always been good anytime we've ordered here. If the company would police their products, check stock, and check the dining area more often, it could easily be a near perfect Panera. But as it sets, it's a 3.5 on a normal day up to a 4 star place when they're cooking.",

Extra points for whoever came up with the idea to out see through igloo\"s just outside the restaurant patio next to the bridges. Yes, you are reading that correctly. You can spend a romantic dinner in a see-through igloo with white lights and all the night sky in an intimate, darker setting.  You only find two of these, so i would book in advance for this special venue.\nMy date and I absolutely loved the decor, atmosphere, staff, and the food.\n\nI have a gluten allergy to Wheat, and all the staff went out of their way to make sure my night was perfect with no cross-contamination.\n\nThe owner, manager, and all the staff were top-notch for a true white glove fine dining should be.\n\nNow to the food. I ordered the salad, thinking it would be on the smaller side.  Nope, it was a large portion and amazing flavor with ingredients not used much in salads you would find at a restaurant. This was a real chef cooked/ prepared to order.\nNext, we had the grilled chicken mini sliders with a sauce that was delicious to dip into. I'm not sure what it was, but wow, it made the flavors come out more.\nI also got the garlic mashed potatoes. This was definitely my favorite with just the right amount of ingredients and fresh potatoes, not instant garage, like some restaurants try to pass as mashed potatoes. Nope, nothing but the best and finest quality of food, cooked to order Cordon Bleu chef.\nThey had a gluten free buns, so I got a grilled chicken sandwich that was delicious.\n\nThe evening was nothing less but magical with the sunset going down the stung lights in the igloo. Dinner was just perfect and a nice walk on the bridges to in the evening.\n\nI would highly recommend this restaurant and experience for your next romantic dinner date.\n\nDon't take my word for it make. Go see for yourself the magic that awaits.\n\nWould I recommend this restaurant?  Absolutely\nWould I return?  Absolutely",

        "text": "10/10 dining experience! We ordered the biscuits appetizer and these were seriously the best biscuits either of us had ever had. Incredible butter, 2 different kinds of jelly, and an apple butter. Then for dinner I ordered the duck \"whitebird\" meal in hopes of something I had never had before - the unique vegetable hash was hearty and delicious (even dabbled with the extra apple butter to add some sweetness with great success) and the duck was very palatable. Very wonderful dinner. My girlfriend ordered the pork belly small dinner plate and was very surprised to love what she ordered. Our waitress was incredibly positive, detailed, came to the table at the right moments, gave positive insight into dishes we had questions about, and kept our drinks full. Other staff came by the table smiling but not intrusively which we thought was very welcoming. Also, big props to the hostess (I believe her name was Reagan?) for securing us our table on Valentine's Day evening when we needed to change our time to later in the evening. The atmosphere was warm and modern without over-sophistication. Loved that we could see the kitchen staff working methodically in the back. After the experience with the biscuit appetizer we're thrilled to try brunch one day! We will be back!",

There a lot of different flavors to explore through their dishes.\n\nThey also have half off oysters during happy hour. They have a large variety which were all delicious.\n\nThe tasting menu was a very great way to sample a lot of the items. It was very filled.\n\nThey also have an excellent tea menu as well as coffee.\n\nI personally found their mock tails to be egregiously overpriced. It's about $8 for what seemed to be about 4 oz.

Our server was knowledgeable and the perfect host. We started with a Zinfandel and nonalcolic chuck taylor that was delicious. Followed by a seaweed and mushroom broth that we could have had more servings of. We went on to a radicchio salad and Rabbitt that was the perfect starter. Next time we will try the mussels! Everything sounds so good. Dinner was the blue crab fusilli and the truffle macaroni and the pasta is delicious! House made with the best sauces. Dessert was the sesame panna cotta and if you go seafood all night I highly recommend this to end the night with. We also the profiteroles with coffee icecream and can easily say this a crowd favourite and something we will dream about forever . We can\u2019t wait to go back",

The burgers were good and tasty, just smaller than the last time we stopped in. The fried pickles had too much breading on them, and we could hardly taste the pickles. We enjoy outdoor seating, especially on cooler sunny days, but this particular day another couple had their 2 dogs off leash that kept coming over to us in line and at our table jumping up on us and begging for food. I know the dogs are not the responsibility of the Caf\u00e9 but it did take away from our Sunday lunch having to deal with someone else dogs. We will come and do recommend to others to stop by",

I am a local resident here in this county and I was not acknowledged or helped today.\n\nI was the third customer in line to order my food when a female guide decided to slip right in front of me to order. I didn\u2019t say anything and decided to give her some grace, assuming that she was on a tight timeline to get to another river run. Several other guides then walked around from the side of the building and decided to all cut in front of me by pretending that the girl was saving their place in line. They all knew I was standing right there and they played the \u2018let\u2019s not give the eye contact game\u2019. What made me even more upset was that they ended up ordering food for several other people! The lady at the register witnessed all of this go down and when it was finally my turn to order, she ended up closing the window screen on me and told me that she needed time to put the previous orders together before helping me. I have never felt this type of discrimination before in my life. I totally get that the local businesses here in Ocoee depend on river tourism. Don\u2019t forget! Your intended customer base is only seasonal. Us locals give y\u2019all business year round, especially during the slow down months. Do better.",

Friendly and attentive is all I ask for so that I know my food is being handled with love. So kudos for that at this location across the board.\n\nHowever I found a very tiny, thick hair in my burger last night and was disappointed but not surprised. I think the few times I have walked in I have noticed that people with beards or mustaches have not been wearing any facial covering at all which i\u2019m sure is definitely required when preparing food.\n\nAll I ask is you guys receive this feedback with sincerity and not as a simple diss. I love the quality and taste yall bring in a difficult industry as someone who has been through it but I think the standards just need a slight nudge to ensure quality is upheld.\n\nTo the workers yall are excellent, but simply ask yourself if you would want to find someone else\u2019s hair in your food. It\u2019s extremely important to keeping reputation which ensures your livelihood with a job.\n\nI know the pay is probably not what you\u2019d want, but coming from another struggling minimum wage worker I simply want quality and safety when paying a lot more for my food and to not feel like my money isn\u2019t going where I want it to getting a Micky D\u2019s level of care.\n\nBeside this issue, you guys are fantastic cooks and get it done and always LOVE the overwhelming amount of fries! Anyone saying yall don\u2019t make quality burgers don\u2019t know jack about a good burger!\n\nJust please make sure you guys follow standard procedures like clean working stations, interchanging gloves regularly, and wearing beard covers properly! That\u2019s all I ask and I know the good stuff will come my way every time.",

We had two pasta dishes, both were obviously reheated as the pasta was tough and dry in spots in the sauce was lukewarm at best. We also ordered chicken, which was very good. We ordered fries, they had to be sitting somewhere else for over 15 minutes before they made it to our table. I never send food back, but I sent back one of the pasta dishes and the fries. The fries were redone and came out piping, hot and delicious. Our server noted that they were out of the pasta dish and couldn\u2019t provide another, needless to say I was surprised to see it still on our bill when we went to leave. I really like this place and want to support it, but it\u2019s gonna take a while for me to want to come back after last night\u2019s meal.",

Throughout the years they have always have the loveliest staff, the best beer selections, and now an impressive selection of mixed drinks and mocktails. Their food truck has a few staple items but also a rotating menu to keep things exciting - I am never disappointed with the food here. The ambience is another reason I always find myself coming back - casual, smaller, mood lighting, games, occasional live music. Let's not forget their incredible happy hour deals. If you're looking for a chill, local spot (with no kids too) that screams \"Chattanooga\" this it!!",

        "text": "This is such a beautiful resort and restaurant that our dining experience was unexpected. The food was mediocre at best.  My husband and I started with the burnt ends which were too salty, to the point it was unpleasant to eat.  We both ordered the trout for our entree which was very strong/dry.  Our friends ordered the trout \u201cdip\u201d which was no dip at all but rather a chunk of trout with some oil on the side.  It was served with deep fried bread which seemed an odd pairing.  The potato gnocchi that came with the trout was my favorite part of the meal.  Regarding the service, it was painfully slow\u2026some of the slowest service I have probably ever encountered.   We had a manageable table of 6, not a huge group.  I hope this was just a bad night for the restaurant.  Ultimately we were there for the food so although it is a gorgeous restaurant/resort, the food was sub par for the cost and expectations for a fine dining restaurant of this caliber.  We won\u2019t be back.  As an aside, we have been to Auld Alliance which was a wonderful experience both with the food and service.",

        "text": "We went away for the weekend to destress. When we got there all seemed well. We were greeted and the staff seemed friendly. However, we get up to our room and there\u2019s barely any room to move around. There are no closets, there\u2019s a couple of drawers under the bed But there is nowhere to set your stuff except for a small table and a chair.  The first night at around 11:30 pm one of the valets let a homeless person to use the restroom and she ended up pulling the fire alarm. So throughout the entire hotel while we are trying to rest from a long travel in, we had to listen to the fire alarm going off For 30 minutes. When it first started, I called downstairs to see if there\u2019s anything that we should do when The answer the phone they were just unprofessional laughing and carrying on while none of us knew what we\u2019re supposed to be doing if we should evacuate et cetera.  But then again, I don\u2019t think it bothered all of the people that were downstairs on the first floor in the bar area playing pool, singing karaoke till after midnight and you could hear them loud and clear on the second floor where we were.  Then the hotel is obviously downtown so good luck getting any sleep with the cars that are sitting there at the stoplight right by the windows revving their engines.  The most aggravating part I think of this entire trip was the parking situation period. You can get valet parking for $16 or you can self park for $22 which makes no sense. So we chose self parking because they told us that there was parking right around the back of the hotel for guests. We were able to find a parking spot when we got there but we also arrived at around 4:30 pm. We left and had dinner and came back and there was not one single parking space open for paying hotel guests so we went into the front to ask and they said that there was overflow parking which was way out in the back lot unlit no security in downtown Chattanooga. I don\u2019t think so. They said it was other people parking in the hotel guest parking spots that were going to other restaurants, hotels et cetera. The point is there is no parking, unless you find a place to park and Uber around town you will spend most of your time finding a place to park. So if you are wanting to distress, don\u2019t stay here because you will get so incredibly frustrated at the fact that you just paid $22 to have secure assigned hotel guest parking and you can\u2019t fund a spot to park!! There is a $50 deposit that you were not told about until you get there and so far. I\u2019m on day three and still not have received my deposit back.  The door to the bathroom does not stay shut unless you lock it, and the hot water at the sink we had on full blast and it was barely warm but then the people beside us we would hear their toilet flush and then all of a sudden our water would get really hot.  Is it Clean, yes but what\u2019s the point of staying in a clean hotel room? If you have noise the entire time you are there you can\u2019t find a place to park and they allow anybody and everybody to come in and use the bathroom and then you end up staying awake all night because of a fire alarm and people downstairs making a bunch of noise.",

We werent even her table but she could sense something was wrong. She checked on us and even checked on why our food was taking so long. Her energy, her spirit, and customer service were phenomenal!!!! She is the only reason we stayed. She is such a beautiful soul, I cannot say enough about her!!!!

The waitress for one was not welcoming nor was she educated on the wine selection and food. She seemed to get annoyed with us asking her about the wine. She had no clue how to explain the taste of the wine and rushed us to place our wine order. For a place that promotes upscale dining, this is not acceptable. The food on the other hand was plated very unappealing, not what is expected for that type of money. Some of the food was served to us burnt, some things were missing from the food. Just overall, it was a bad experience. I left there feeling dissatisfied.",

From the very beginning the waitress was losing her patience; she knew nothing about the alcohol served to describe or make suggestions to us, along with the meals on the menu (and there weren't even a lot)! She brought out no condiments so everything each one of us asked for annoyed her, one time she wouldn't even acknowledge that we asked for something but brought it out anyways! The food was pricey and not good. The appetizers were burnt and when we explained to the waitress she said that they were supposed to be that way! One of the salads, a pecan salad, came with no pecans and when asked she replied that they were out of pecans, did not even think to let us know ahead of time so that we could order something else! The service was terrible and the food was bad! No wonder, even with the live jazz, they were so empty on a Friday night!",

I finally asked about my coffee order and I was told they were really busy. Another white lady who was behind me stated that what happened was wrong and that I was ignored so I know it wasn't just me.\nSubsequently, a few moments later a completely different person called my name and sat my coffee on the pickup counter.

We waited over an hour and a half to be served our meal. When our food did come out it was wrong, and the waiter seemed upset at us for her mistake. The waiter also brought me a salad that was meant for another table, and proceeded to tell the kitchen staff that I claimed the salad when she brought it out. The waiter then proceeded to charge us $7.00 for the salad we did not order. The manager did take off the salad after we told her the situation. She then proceeded to offer us a free appetizer if we came back on Thursday night. I do not believe this made up for the three hours we were there, the staff blaming me for their mistake, and them getting our order wrong. I am not giving you more business for a free appetizer. I would say the food is absolutely delicious, but if you go be prepared to wait a long time. I believe they were having a bad night and I want to give them the benefit of the doubt, but I just can\u2019t go back after the experience we had tonight.",

I am sad that the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e isn\u2019t available anymore, as it was stunning, but I love everything I\u2019ve ever had from the menu. The food is northern Italian-style, and so delicious. We still make the three-hour round trip for our anniversary and it is so, so worth it. Highly recommend Boccaccia! It\u2019s such a reasonable price for the quality of the food. Definitely make sure you get reservations ahead of time, too. It\u2019s a small place, but I love that. Don\u2019t miss this gem!",
